## Chapter 3 Methods

- In static type checking, the compiler can spot of your mistakes before the code runs, but you have to write a lot of *boilerplate methods*

### Dynamic Methods

- **Dynamic Dispatch**: decide which method to call at runtime.
- `send` → calls methods dynamically
- `define_method` → define mthods dynamically

- The `$1` is group matched from the regular expression above `/(.+)_id$/`. The `$1` variable is the string matched in the parenthesis.

### method_missing

- when a object calls a method, ruby finds whether its class has the method, if not, it finds its ancestor chain. If still not, it will find whether there is `method_missing`
- overriding `method_missing` allows you to call methods that don't really exist.
- remember to override `respond_to_missing?` every time you override `method_missing`
- `const_missing`

### Ghost method and dynamic proxy

- **ghost methods** are the methods that generated by method_missing
    - From the caller's side, a message that's processed by method_missing looks like a regular call
    - on the receiver's side, it has no corresponding method
- **dynamic proxy**: an object which catches ghost methods and forwards them to another object
- `respond_to?` → check whether a class has the method

- ghost methods will return *false* in `respond_to?`
- what is truly `respond_to_missing?`???????

### Debugging in method_missing

> Bugs in a method_missing can be difficult to squash.
